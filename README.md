# Project tasks

In order to divide the work equally among team members and ensure that the project is completed on time, we have divided the tasks into the following categories:

# Data collection and preparation

 Gather a diverse dataset of dress images
 
 Preprocess the images to ensure they are suitable for training
 
 Split the dataset into training and validation sets
 
# GAN development and training

 Design the GAN architecture
 
 Train the GAN on the dataset
 
 Fine-tune the GAN to improve results
 
Evaluation and testing

 Evaluate the quality of the generated dresses using appropriate metrics
 
 Test the GAN on a hold-out test set
 
 Identify any potential issues or improvements that can be made
 
 # Documentation and presentation
 
 Write a detailed report on the project
 Create a presentation to showcase the results of the project
 Write clear and concise documentation for the project code
